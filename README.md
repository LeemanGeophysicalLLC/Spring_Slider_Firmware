# Spring Slider Earthquake Machine Firmware

This repo contains the Arduino code for the [spring slider earthquake machine](https://leemangeophysical.com/product/spring-slider/)
developed and sold by Leeman Geophysical LLC. Be sure to check the documents section of the
product page on our website for lab activities, users guides, and more!

The Arduino program is relatively straight forward as it reads a load cell amplifier (HX711)
and controls the motor using the control pendant and speed dial inputs. Relevant libraries
are included so it should be easy to compile and upload.

We welcome contributions of improvements or bug fixes to the code. Please be concious of the
requirement for backwards compatability until major version releases to keep our product
running smoothly for the many users of the earthquake machine worldwide.

ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THIS CODE ARE MADE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
